<h1>Hello, welcome to my webpage!</h1>
<p>This webpage is built using HTML, CSS, and HTTP. Let's learn a bit about each of these technologies:</p>
<h2>HTTP</h2>
<p>HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web. When you enter a URL in your browser's address bar, your computer sends an HTTP request to the server where the webpage is hosted. The server then sends an HTTP response, which includes the HTML, CSS, and other files that make up the webpage.</p>
<h2>CSS</h2>
<p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. CSS allows you to control the layout, colors, and other visual elements of a webpage, separate from the structure and content defined by HTML.</p>
